Questions,
    1. How do you write comments in a c program? What is the purpose of comments in a program?

    2. Which is the function that is essential in a C program?

    3. What is the purpose of ‘scanf’ ?

    4. Is ‘standard c’ a case sensitive language?

    5. Determine which of the following are valid identifiers. If invalid, explain why.
        (a)  record1  (e)  $tax    (h)  name-and-address
        (b)  1record  (f)  name    (i)  name_and_address
        (c)  file-3   (g)  name and address    (j)  123 - 45  - 6789
        (d)  return

    6. State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
        a) Function printf always begins printing at the beginning of a new line.
        b) Comments cause the computer to print the text enclosed between /* and */ on the screen
        when the program is executed.
        c) The escape sequence \n when used in a printf format control string causes the cursor to
        position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
        d) All variables must be defined before they’re used.
        e) All variables must be given a type when they’re defined.
        f) C considers the variables, number and NuMbEr to be identical.
        g) A program that prints three lines of output must contain three  printf statements.

    7. What does the following code print?
        printf( "*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n" );

    8. Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements. (Note: There may be more than
    one error per statement.)
        a) scanf( "d", value );
        b) printf( "The product of %d and %d is %d"\n, x, y );
        c) Scanf( "%d", anInteger );
        d) printf( "Remainder of %d divided by %d is\n", x, y, x % y );
        e) print( "The sum is %d\n," x + y );
        f) Printf( "The value you entered is: %d\n, &value );

    9. What, if anything, prints when each of the following statements is performed? If nothing prints, then
    answer “Nothing.” Assume  x = 2 and  y = 3 .
        a) printf( "%d", x );
        b) printf( "%d", x + x );
        c) printf( "x=" );
        d) printf( "x=%d", x );
        e) printf( "%d = %d", x + y, y + x );
        f) z = x + y;
        g) scanf( "%d%d", &x, &y );
        h) /* printf( "x + y = %d", x + y ); */
        i) printf( "\n" );

    10. State which of the following are true and which are false. If false, explain your answer.
        a) C operators are evaluated from left to right.
        b) The following are all valid variable names: _under_bar_ ,  m928134 ,  t5 ,  j7 ,  her_sales ,
        his_account_total ,  a ,  b ,  c ,  z ,  z2 .
        c) The statement printf("a = 5;"); is a typical example of an assignment statement.
        d) A valid arithmetic expression containing no parentheses is evaluated from left to right.
        e) The following are all invalid variable names:  3g ,  87 ,  67h2 ,  h22 ,  2h

        Comments are used to explain the code for a third person who is reading the code. It should
        carry enough context to understand the code without having to read the code. Comments are
        ignored by the compiler. In object C comments are written using /* */ or //.

    2.
        main() function is essential in a C program, it is executed first when the program is run.
        It is simply the entry point of the program.

    3.
        scanf() is used to read input from STDIN (standard input), or in simple words it is used to
        read input from the user. It is used with the format specifiers to cast the data into a desired
        data type.

    4. C is a case sensitive language.

    5.
        (a) Valid
        (b) Invalid, variable names cannot start with a number.
        (c) Invalid, variable names cannot contain special characters except underscore.
        (d) Valid
        (e) Valid
        (f) Valid
        (g) Invalid, variable names cannot contain spaces.
        (h) Invalid, variable names cannot contain special characters except underscore.
        (i) Valid
        (j) Invalid, variable names cannot contain spaces.

    6.
        a) False, printf() prints the output on the same line unless a newline character is used.
        b) False, comments are ignored by the compiler.
        c) True
        d) True
        e) True
        f) False, C is a case sensitive language.
        g) False, a single printf() statement can print multiple lines.

    8.
        a) scanf("%d", &value);
        b) printf("The product of %d and %d is %d\n", x, y, x * y);
        c) scanf("%d", &anInteger);
        d) printf("Remainder of %d divided by %d is %d\n", x, y, x % y);
        e) printf("The sum is %d\n", x + y);
        f) printf("The value you entered is: %d\n", value);

        e) 5 = 5
        f) Nothing

        i) A new line

    10.
        a) True
        b) True
        c) False, it is a function call.
        d) False, it is evaluated according to the precedence of the operators.
        e) False, variable names cannot start with a number.
